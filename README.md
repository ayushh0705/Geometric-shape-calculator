Python Geometric Shapes Calculator
Overview
Welcome to the Python Geometric Shapes Calculator! This Python program serves as a versatile tool for calculating the area and perimeter of three fundamental geometric shapes: circles, rectangles, and triangles. Whether you're a student learning Python or a developer interested in applying object-oriented principles to solve practical problems, this program provides a clear example of clean code organization and modularity.

Features
Object-Oriented Design:

The program utilizes object-oriented programming principles, with a base class, Shape, containing abstract methods for area and perimeter. Specialized shape classes (Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle) inherit from the base class, showcasing the power of inheritance and encapsulation.
Mathematical Computations:

The Circle class employs Python's math module to calculate the area and perimeter based on the provided radius.
The Rectangle class effortlessly handles rectangles, allowing users to input length and width for accurate computations.
The Triangle class introduces additional complexity, enabling users to input parameters such as base, height, and side lengths.
User-Friendly Interface:

The program features an intuitive interface that allows users to input dimensions and witness instant calculations of geometric properties.
